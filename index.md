**Techstacks:** Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Data Wrangling, Data Exploration (EDA), Data Visualization

During this Udacity project, I investigated [TMDB movie dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata) which contains information about 10,000 movies. After data analysis steps of data wrangling, and EDA, I provided some useful insights about the data set through answering these following questions with visualizations:

- Question 1: Which genres are most popular overtime ?
- Question 2: What are time series of top 5 movie genres?
- Question 3: What are factors associated with revenue levels?
