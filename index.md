### Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree

[IMDB Dataset Investigation](/udacity/imdb/imdb-movie.html)

**Techstacks:** Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Data Wrangling, Data Exploration (EDA), Data Visualization

During this Udacity project, TMDb movie data set which contains information about 10,000 movies. In terms of the data set, it was cleaned from original data on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata">Kaggle</a>, and is about to get cleaned second time to focus and answer the main questions.
After data analysis steps of data wrangling, and EDA, I hope to provide some useful insights about the data set through answering these following questions with visualizations:

- Question 1: Which genres are most popular overtime ?
- Question 2: What are time series of top 5 movie genres?
- Question 3: What are factors associated with revenue levels?
